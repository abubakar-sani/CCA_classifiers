# RF Jamming Dataset: A Wireless Spectral Scan Approach for Malicious Interference Detection

## Overview

Future wireless networks are envisioned to incorporate awareness, adaptability, and intelligence as core components to cater to the diverse needs of next-generation communication systems. While wireless sensing techniques can harness awareness from surrounding radio signals, they are also susceptible to threats from hostile attackers, including jamming, eavesdropping, and manipulation.

This repository provides detailed insights into an RF-jamming detection testbed and shares experimentally measured data. The testbed leverages the spectral scan capability of wireless network interfaces and JamRF, a specialized jamming toolkit.
